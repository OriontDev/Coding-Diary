# HTML Code Explanation: Audio Tags and Attributes

This code showcases the use of the `<audio>` element to embed audio files in a web page. Below are explanations of the attributes used in the code:

## Attributes of the `<audio>` Tag

1. **`controls`**
   - Displays playback controls (play, pause, volume, etc.) for the user.
   - Without this attribute, users cannot interact with the audio element.

2. **`autoplay`**
   - Automatically starts playing the audio as soon as the page loads.
   - Note: Many modern browsers block autoplay unless muted or triggered by user interaction.

3. **`muted`**
   - Mutes the audio by default when it starts playing.

4. **`loop`**
   - Ensures the audio will replay automatically once it ends.

## `<source>` Tag and Attributes
The `<source>` tag specifies the source file for the audio.

1. **`src`**
   - Defines the file path to the audio file to be played.
   - Example: `src="Anthem.mp3"`

2. **`type`**
   - Specifies the MIME type of the audio file (e.g., `audio/mpeg`, `audio/wav`).
   - Helps the browser determine if it can play the file.

## Additional Notes

- If the browser cannot play the specified audio format, it will attempt to play the next `<source>` tag.
- Placing multiple `<source>` tags allows fallback options for different audio formats.
- Without the `type` attribute in the `<source>` tag, the browser attempts to infer the file type from the file extension.
