### HTML Basic Notes

This code demonstrates the basics of HTML structure and elements. Below is an explanation of the various tags used:

---

### **Code Explanation**

1. **`<!DOCTYPE html>`**
   - Declares the document type and version of HTML. 
   - This ensures the browser interprets the document as HTML5.

2. **`<html>`**
   - The root element of an HTML document.
   - Encloses all the content on the webpage.

3. **`<head>`**
   - Contains metadata and links related to the document.
   - Metadata includes the title, links to stylesheets, scripts, etc.
   - Content here is not displayed directly on the webpage.

4. **`<title>`**
   - Sets the title of the webpage.
   - This appears on the browser tab.

5. **`<body>`**
   - Contains the content of the webpage visible to users.
   - Includes text, images, headings, links, and more.

6. **`<h1>` to `<h5>`**
   - Headings are used to define the hierarchy and structure of the content.
   - `<h1>` is the largest and most important heading, while `<h5>` is smaller and less significant.

7. **`<hr>`**
   - Creates a horizontal rule (line) to separate sections.

8. **`<br>`**
   - Inserts a line break in the content.
   - Useful for spacing when text should continue on the next line.

9. **`<p>`**
   - Defines a paragraph of text.
   - Automatically adds some space before and after the content.

10. **`<pre>`**
    - Preserves whitespace, line breaks, and formatting.
    - Displays text exactly as written in the code, ideal for code snippets or preformatted content.

### **Rendered Output**

Hereâ€™s what the webpage will look like:

#### Headings:
- **This is a h1 heading**
- **This is a h2 heading**
- **This is a h3 heading**
- **This is a h4 heading**
- **This is a h5 heading**

---

#### Horizontal Line:
A line will appear beneath the headings, separating the content.

---

#### Paragraph:
A block of text with regular formatting:
> Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit. Praesentium expedita distinctio nam et neque eaque iste modi beatae, ipsum, architecto eius sunt dolores maxime? Beatae maiores illum nisi animi sapiente.

---

#### Preformatted Text:
Text will appear exactly as written in the code (indented and spaced):
```
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. 
Corrupti sapiente laborum dolor placeat qui commodi id perspiciatis quod, 
amet delectus est velit eius cumque, ab, consequatur sed in quae quasi!
```

### **Why Use These Tags?**

- **`<p>`**: For regular, structured text.
- **`<pre>`**: For preserving formatting (useful for displaying code or examples).
- **Headings**: To structure your content and improve readability.
- **`<br>` and `<hr>`**: For creating visual separation and layout adjustments.
- **Metadata Tags (`<head>` and `<title>`)**: To provide essential information for browsers and search engines.
