        <p>E Ihowā Atua<br>
            O ngā iwi mātou rā<br>
            Āta whakarangona <br>
            Me aroha noa<br>
            Kia hua ko te pai <br>
            Kia tau tō atawhai<br>
            Manaakitia mai<br>
            Aotearoa.
            <br>
            <br>
            God of Nations at Thy feet<br>
            In the bonds of love we meet<br>
            Hear our voices, we entreat<br>
            God defend our free land<br>
            Guard Pacific's triple star<br>
            From the shafts of strife and war<br>
            Make her praises heard afar<br>
            God defend New Zealand</p>

        <p><b>"God Defend New Zealand"</b> was written in 1876 by poet Thomas Bracken and set to music by John Joseph Woods,
             who composed the melody in response to a competition. Originally a patriotic hymn, it gained popularity over the years and was frequently performed at public events. 
             In 1940, it was prominently featured during the centenary of the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Waitangi" style="color: inherit;"><b>Treaty of Waitangi</b></a>. It officially became one of New Zealand's national anthems in 1977, 
             alongside "God Save the King," symbolizing the nation's cultural identity and independence.
