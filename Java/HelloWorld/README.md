# Hello, World! Java Program

This simple Java program demonstrates the fundamental structure of a Java program. It outputs two lines of text to the console: 
- "Hello, World!"
- "This is so complicated"

## Code Explanation

### Code Breakdown:

```java
public class helloworld {
```
This defines a public class named `helloworld`. In Java, every program must have at least one class.

```java
    public static void main(String[] args) {
```
This is the `main` method, which serves as the entry point for any Java application. When you run the program, execution starts here. 

- **public**: Makes the method accessible from anywhere.
- **static**: Allows the method to run without creating an instance of the class.
- **void**: Indicates that the method does not return any value.
- **String[] args**: A parameter that can hold command-line arguments (not used in this program).

```java
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
```
This line prints the text `Hello, World!` to the console. The `System.out.println` method is used for outputting text followed by a newline.

```java
        System.out.println("This is so complicated");
```
Similarly, this line outputs `This is so complicated` to the console.

## How to Run the Program

1. **Install Java**:
   - Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your computer.
   - You can download it from [Oracle's official website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html).

2. **Write the Code**:
   - Save the code in a file named `helloworld.java`.

3. **Compile the Code**:
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the directory containing `helloworld.java`.
   - Run the command:
     ```bash
     javac helloworld.java
     ```
   - This will create a file named `helloworld.class` if there are no syntax errors.

4. **Run the Program**:
   - Execute the compiled program with the command:
     ```bash
     java helloworld
     ```
   - You should see the following output:
     ```
     Hello, World!
     This is so complicated
     ```

## Notes for Beginners

- Java is case-sensitive. For example, `public` must be lowercase, and `System` must start with an uppercase letter.
- Every statement in Java ends with a semicolon (`;`).
- The class name `helloworld` should match the filename `helloworld.java`. If you change the class name, ensure the file name matches.

When im writting this its my first day of leaning java and it feels so complicated already..
