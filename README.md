# Coding-Diary
This repository is my personal coding diary. Here, I document my journey of learning and practicing programming. This repo also serve as my notes to look back on everytime im coding.

## Why I Created This
I believe that consistent practice and reflection are key to improving as a programmer. By maintaining this repository, I can:
- Track my progress and the concepts I've learned.
- Refer back to specific implementations or techniques when needed.
- Build a portfolio of projects that showcase my growth over time.

Each folder in this repository contains code for a specific concept or project, along with a detailed `README.md` explaining how the code works. This way, anyone viewing my diary can understand what I’m learning and how I’m applying it.

Feel free to explore the repository and learn alongside me! :3
